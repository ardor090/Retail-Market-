Project Description:
Mr Adamu has a retail market where he sells daily basic food items. The table below shows the items, available quantity and prices. 
a.	As a python developer you were told to develop a python program that keeps in check stock details, pricing and others. Let your program have the following basic functionality (note: you can add your own):
1.	An inbuilt function for admin to change the price of any of the items.
2.	An inbuilt function for admins to add more items.
3.	An inbuilt function to compute goods purchased per customer and displays a receipt for printing.
a.	The function must be able to add 20% VAT for customers buying less than 5 items.
b.	30% VAT for customers buying more than 10 items.
c.	N800 bonus goods for customers purchasing more than 10 items with the least amount being N100.
4.	An inbuilt function that updates stock after an item has been purchased.
5.	An inbuilt function that takes record of total gain per day.
b.	Write a test program, that communicates with the buyer, taking note of the following:
i.	Displays the available items.
ii.	Their corresponding price.
iii.	Receives items customers want to buy, and their corresponding quantities.
iv.	Computes their total payment.
v.	Finally display to the customers, a receipt (with the item purchased, quantity, corresponding prices and total price). Also display discounts (if any).
